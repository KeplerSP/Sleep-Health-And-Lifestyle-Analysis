# Sleep Health & Lifestyle Analysis

## Description
Explore the intricate relationship between sleep health, cardiovascular metrics, and lifestyle factors with this comprehensive Power BI project. This repository contains a synthetic dataset featuring approximately 400 fictive individuals, each with a unique profile reflecting key health and lifestyle parameters.

## Key Dataset Attributes:
- Person ID
- Gender
- Age
- Occupation
- Sleep Duration: Average daily hours of sleep
- Quality of Sleep: Subjective rating on a 1-10 scale
- Physical Activity Level: Average daily minutes of physical activity
- Stress Level: Subjective rating on a 1-10 scale
- BMI Category
- Blood Pressure: Indicated as systolic over diastolic pressure
- Heart Rate: Measured in beats per minute
- Daily Steps
- Sleep Disorder: Classified as None, Insomnia, or Sleep Apnea

## Key Findings

### 1. BMI Impact on Sleep Duration
**Conclusion:** Individuals with a normal BMI category demonstrate significantly longer average sleep duration (7.4 hours) compared to overweight (7.0 hours) and obese (6.8 hours) individuals. This suggests a strong correlation between maintaining a healthy weight and achieving adequate sleep, with a difference of approximately 36 minutes between normal and obese categories.

### 2. Occupational Sleep Patterns
**Conclusion:** Sleep duration varies dramatically across different professions, with engineers averaging the highest at approximately 8.5 hours, while sales representatives report the lowest at around 6 hours. This 2.5-hour difference highlights how work-related factors such as stress levels, work schedules, and job demands significantly influence sleep patterns across occupational groups.

### 3. Blood Pressure and Sleep Problems
**Conclusion:** There is a clear inverse relationship between blood pressure levels and sleep quality. Individuals with Stage 2 hypertension show the highest prevalence of sleep problems (36.63%), more than three times higher than those with normal blood pressure (10.96%). This indicates that cardiovascular health and sleep disorders are closely interconnected.

### 4. Blood Pressure Categories and Sleep Metrics
**Conclusion:** Normal blood pressure is strongly associated with superior sleep quality and duration. As blood pressure increases from normal through elevated to hypertension stages, both sleep duration and quality ratings decline progressively, demonstrating that cardiovascular health is a critical factor in achieving restorative sleep.

### 5. Heart Rate and Sleep Quality
**Conclusion:** Lower resting heart rates (60-70 bpm) are associated with better sleep quality and longer sleep duration. As heart rate increases into the 71-80 and 81-90 bpm ranges, both metrics decline. This finding emphasizes the relationship between cardiovascular fitness and sleep health, suggesting that individuals with lower resting heart rates achieve more restorative sleep.
